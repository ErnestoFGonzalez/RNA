- Normalize "Precipitation vs Distance" plots, dividing by ring area or ring radius.
The bigger the distance the bigger the surface area of the considered ring.
Normal behavior is to have more precipitation.

- Use Hoshen and Kopelman algorithm to describe precipitation aggregates size
distribution. Use M(k) to compute how many pairs at distance between d and d+1
have simultaneous precipitation: if two pairs have simultaneous precipitation
we register 1, otherwise 0.

- Remove avalanches of size less than 2 from "Avalanche-size frequency vs
Avalanche-size". Find out line slope.
